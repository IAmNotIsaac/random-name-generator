# random-name-generator
just a simple random name gernator, follows super simple syllabic rules too

make sure you have tkinter if you want to run it from gui.py

how to use:
1. import `generator.py`
2. call `generate_name()` from `generator`

ex.:

`main.py`
```
import generator as gen

print(gen.generate_name())
```

pretty simple
